![Image title](assets/splinter-elephant.png){ width="300" }

This project maintains a set of lints for Supabase projects. It uses SQL queries to identify common database schema issues. Some lints are general purpose for Postgres projects while others are specific to Supabase features, storing their data in Postgres e.g. auth and storage.
